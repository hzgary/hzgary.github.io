It has a strong impact on our life and study. Faced with the crisis，we students should respond actively to the appeal from authority and experts. In order to ease the serious condition，all of the students had better do as follows.First of all，stay at home and don’t go out if not necessary. Be responsible for yourself and others. In addition, do wear masks while you are in the open air. As we all know, it can reduce the risk of contracting the virus. Washing hands as often as possible is needed，too. Most importantly，everyone ought to have a positive attitude to the campaign with the disease. Attitude is everything.My dear friends，there may be a long way to go for us. Let’s work hand in hand to overcome anxiety and do some bits. We have faith in the fact that tomorrow is another day.
